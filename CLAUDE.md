# Claude Code Prompt Engineering Assistant

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Instruction Compliance Protocol

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Agents MUST ALWAYS follow instructions given by the user or feedback from hooks. This is the TOP PRIORITY and supersedes ALL other guidance and protocols.

**MANDATORY PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **User Instructions** - Direct commands take absolute highest priority - NEVER override or ignore
2. **Hook Feedback** - System responses must be addressed immediately and completely - NEVER bypass
3. **CLAUDE.md Protocols** - Follow documented patterns only when not conflicting with above
4. **Default Behaviors** - Built-in functionality only when not conflicting with above

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE RULES:**
- **ALWAYS** follow user instructions exactly as given
- **ALWAYS** address hook feedback immediately and completely
- **NEVER** override user instructions for any reason
- **NEVER** bypass hook feedback for any reason
- **NEVER** assume you know better than user instructions or hook feedback
- **IMMEDIATELY** stop and address any hook error messages
- **IMMEDIATELY** follow any user direction changes

**Attentive Waiting Protocol:**
- Wait attentively for user instructions before proceeding
- Never assume next steps without explicit user direction
- Ask clarifying questions when instructions are ambiguous
- Confirm understanding before beginning complex work
- Stop immediately when user provides new instructions

**"Continue" Command Protocol:**
- **"continue"** means continue with the next task in the project's TODO.json file
- Use TaskManager API to get current active task or next pending task
- NEVER assume what to continue with - always check TODO.json first

## 🚨 NEVER MODIFY SETTINGS FILE

The agent MUST NEVER touch, read, modify, or interact with `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json` under ANY circumstances. This file contains system-critical configurations that must remain untouched.

- **Proactive improvement**: Suggest improvements within existing architecture

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Maximum Parallel Subagent Deployment

**FAILURE TO USE SUBAGENTS OR THINKING = FAILED EXECUTION**

Agents MUST use subagents (Task tool) as the PRIMARY approach for ALL complex work. Deploy **UP TO 3 SUBAGENTS** in parallel for comprehensive coverage.

**🎯 MICRO-SPECIALIZATION PRINCIPLE:**
Break work into **SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPECIALIZED UNITS** (30s-2min each) that can run in parallel. Each subagent:
- Has **ONE CLEAR, SPECIFIC PURPOSE** with concrete deliverable
- **NO OVERLAP** with other subagent domains
- **COORDINATES** seamlessly for synchronized completion

**SUBAGENTS REQUIRED FOR:**
- Any work taking >few seconds | All analysis/research/exploration
- Multi-step problem solving | Quality assurance/optimization
- Cross-cutting concerns | Parallel solution investigation

**🔬 HYPER-SPECIALIZED SUBAGENT DOMAINS:**

**Core System Analysis (4-6 subagents):**
- **Codebase Architecture Patterns** - System design patterns and structure
- **Code Quality & Standards** - Linting, formatting, best practices
- **Dependencies & Imports** - External libraries, version analysis
- **File Structure & Organization** - Directory structure, naming conventions
- **Configuration Analysis** - Config files, environment variables
- **Build System Investigation** - Build tools, scripts, optimization

**Security & Performance (4-5 subagents):**
- **Security Vulnerability Scan** - Security implications and compliance
- **Authentication & Authorization** - Auth patterns, permission systems
- **Performance Bottlenecks** - Speed, memory, scalability concerns
- **Database Optimization** - Query performance, indexing, connections
- **Network & API Analysis** - External calls, timeouts, rate limiting

**Testing & Quality Assurance (3-4 subagents):**
- **Test Coverage Analysis** - Existing test quality and gaps
- **Test Strategy Design** - New testing approaches and frameworks
- **Edge Case Identification** - Failure scenarios and resilience
- **Integration Testing** - Cross-component interaction testing
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Only ONE subagent may execute tests to prevent conflicts

**User Experience & Interface (2-3 subagents):**
- **Frontend Components** - UI patterns, component architecture
- **User Flow Analysis** - Interaction patterns, usability
- **Accessibility Review** - A11y compliance and improvements

**Data & State Management (2-3 subagents):**
- **Data Flow Mapping** - Information architecture and flow
- **State Management** - State patterns, data persistence
- **API Design Review** - Endpoint design, data structures

**Infrastructure & Operations (2-3 subagents):**
- **Deployment Strategy** - Infrastructure and deployment considerations
- **Monitoring & Logging** - Observability, error tracking
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automation, testing, deployment flows

**SINGLE-AGENT WORK ONLY FOR:** Single file reads | Trivial edits | Simple parameter changes | Basic status updates

### **🚨 Subagent Coordination & Deployment Patterns**

**🎯 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY: Think → Map → Balance → Deploy Simultaneously**

**DEPLOYMENT RULES:**
- **Think First**: Assess ALL possible parallel work domains before deployment
- **Map Intelligently**: Assign each subagent unique, valuable micro-specialization  
- **Balance Dynamically**: Adjust scope so all subagents complete within 1-2 minutes
- **Deploy Efficiently**: Launch up to 3 beneficial subagents simultaneously
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Zero overlap between subagent responsibilities

**COORDINATION TECHNIQUES:**
- **Complexity Weighting**: Lighter domains get additional scope
- **Adaptive Scoping**: Heavy domains get focused scope
- **Progressive Expansion**: Early finishers expand investigation scope
- **Parallel Validation**: Fast subagents cross-validate slower ones
- **Synchronized Timing**: All subagents complete within 1-2 minutes

**🚀 DEPLOYMENT PATTERNS:**
- **1-2 Subagents**: For moderate tasks
- **2-3 Subagents**: Maximum deployment for comprehensive coverage

**FOCUSED TASK EXAMPLES:**
- "Security Analysis" → 3 subagents: "Auth & Permissions Review", "Data Security & Encryption", "Input Validation & XSS Prevention"
- "Performance Review" → 3 subagents: "Memory & CPU Analysis", "Database & Query Optimization", "API & Network Performance"
- "Code Quality" → 3 subagents: "Standards & Linting", "Type Safety & Logic", "Complexity & Maintainability"

### **🚨 Maximum Thinking & Execution Patterns**

**THINKING ESCALATION:**
- **Simple tasks**: No thinking (single-step trivial work only)
- **Moderate** (2-4 steps): `(think)` - 4,000 tokens
- **Complex** (5-8 steps): `(think hard)` - 10,000 tokens
- **Architecture/system** (9+ steps): `(ultrathink)` - 31,999 tokens

**ULTRATHINK TRIGGERS:** System architecture | Multi-service integration
**THINK HARD TRIGGERS:** Performance optimization | Security planning | Complex refactoring | Debugging | Task planning

**PARALLEL EXECUTION PATTERNS:**
- Multiple Task tools for: Codebase exploration | Documentation analysis | Security audits | Performance analysis
- Follow with thinking: Synthesize findings (think hard) | Design strategy (think hard/ultrathink) | Plan validation (think)

**🚀 DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLES:**

**Feature Implementation (3 subagents):** Auth pattern analysis & API design | Security validation & testing | Database schema & integration → **2-3 min vs 6+ min (2x faster)**

**Bug Investigation (3 subagents):** Config & middleware analysis | Performance & timing analysis | Error patterns & logging analysis → **2-3 min vs 6+ min (2x faster)**

**Code Review (3 subagents):** Code quality & standards | Security & performance | Testing & edge cases → **1-2 min vs 4+ min (2x faster)**

**🎯 DEPLOYMENT DECISION MATRIX:**
- **Simple**: 0-1 subagents (trivial single-file changes only)
- **Moderate**: 1-2 subagents (focused investigation)  
- **Complex**: 2-3 subagents (comprehensive analysis)

**MINDSET SHIFT:** "How can I break this into focused parallel tasks?"
**PRINCIPLE:** 3 subagents × 2 minutes each = **2 minutes total** vs 1 agent × 6 minutes

Think autonomously about **KEY ASPECTS** for **EFFICIENT PARALLEL COVERAGE**.

### **Maximum Concurrent Subagent Patterns**

**SPEED MULTIPLIER FORMULA:** `Time Saved = (Sequential Time ÷ Parallel Subagents) - Coordination Overhead`
**Example:** 6-minute task ÷ 3 subagents = 2 min + 30s coordination = **2.5 min total (2.4x faster)**

**TASK TYPE PATTERNS:**
- **Research Tasks**: 2-3 subagents across key domains
- **Feature Implementation**: 2-3 subagents covering main aspects  
- **Bug Investigation**: 2-3 subagents investigating different causes
- **Code Review**: 2-3 subagents checking quality aspects
- **System Analysis**: 2-3 subagents analyzing components

## Essential Workflow Patterns

**Multi-Phase Approach:**
1. Research existing patterns (deploy subagents to maximize coverage)
2. Create detailed plan (use appropriate thinking level)
3. Implement solution following plan
4. Write comprehensive tests and validate
5. Commit changes and push to remote

**Context Management:** Check/create/update ABOUT.md files | Deploy subagents for research analysis | Update CLAUDE.md with decisions | Document commands/patterns

**Test-Driven Development:** Write tests first | Implement after tests established | Ensure tests fail initially

**Safety Guidelines:** Wait for user permission on major changes | Explain before implementing | Use git branches for experimental features

**Code Quality Standards:** 250/400 line limit | Comprehensive documentation | Type annotations | Input validation | Error handling with logging | No hardcoded secrets | Zero linter errors

## 🔴 Claude Code Execution Environment

### **Claude Code Cannot Run Node.js Natively**

Claude Code operates in a bash-only environment. All Node.js operations must be executed using bash commands with proper wrappers.

**❌ WRONG - Cannot Execute:**
```javascript
const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager');
const result = await taskManager.readTodo();
```

**✅ CORRECT - Must Use Bash:**
```bash
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)));"
```

**Integration with Claude Code Workflow:**
1. Always use bash commands for TaskManager operations
2. Wrap in proper error handling to catch failures
3. Log results to console for visibility
4. Validate operations before critical updates
5. Use JSON.stringify for complex object output

## ADDER+ Protocol Integration

### Infinite Continue Hook System
The system automatically provides mode-based guidance when Claude Code stops by:
1. **Detecting project state** (failing tests, coverage, complexity)
2. **Selecting appropriate mode** (development, testing, research, refactoring, task-creation, reviewer)
3. **Providing mode-specific guidance** and current tasks
4. **Handling coordination automatically**

### Setup for New Projects
```bash
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/path/to/project"
```

### Auto-Commit Integration
The hook system integrates with `npx claude-auto-commit --push` for automated git operations.

## 🚨 Critical Protocols

### **Always Push After Committing**

Every commit MUST be followed by a push to the remote repository to ensure work is backed up and visible to the team.

```bash
# Standard Git Workflow
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement feature description

- Bullet point of accomplishment
- Another accomplishment

🤖 Generated with Claude Code

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
```

**Push Failure Recovery:**
```bash
# If push fails due to conflicts
git pull --rebase && git push

# If push fails due to branch tracking
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### **Linter Error Priority Protocol**

All linter errors MUST be resolved before starting/continuing/completing any task.

**Workflow:** `npm run lint` → `npm run lint:fix` → `npm run lint --format=compact`
**Emergency Protocol:** Fix linter config first | Update to eslint.config.js (ESLint v9) | Install required packages
**Rule:** Never modify ignore files to bypass errors (only for legitimate exclusions)

### **Development Directory Organization**

The `development/` directory should ONLY contain universal files needed for EVERY task. Do NOT add task-specific .md files to this directory.

`development/` = **UNIVERSAL FILES ONLY** (needed for EVERY task)
**ALLOWED:** Universal instructions | Universal workflows | Universal configs | Mode-specific files in `development/modes/`
**FORBIDDEN:** Task-specific docs | Research findings | Implementation notes | Project-specific guides
**RULE:** Task-specific documentation → `development/research-reports/` + TaskManager `important_files`

## TaskManager API Reference

For complete TaskManager API documentation with all methods, examples, and usage patterns, see:
**[TaskManager API Guide](./development/taskmanager-api-guide.md)**

### **Quick Reference - Most Common Operations**

```bash
# Get current task to work on
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(task => console.log(task ? task.title : 'No active tasks'));"

# Mark current task as completed
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(async task => { if(task) { await tm.updateTaskStatus(task.id, 'completed'); console.log('Task completed:', task.title); } });"

# Create new development task quickly  
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.createTask({title: 'Quick Task', description: 'Task description', mode: 'DEVELOPMENT'}).then(id => console.log('Created:', id));"

# Check what tasks are ready to execute (no unmet dependencies)
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getExecutableTasks().then(tasks => console.log('Ready to execute:', tasks.length, 'tasks'));"
```

## 🚨 Task Management

### **TODO.json Interaction Protocol**

**🚨 MANDATORY**: ALL TODO.json write operations MUST use TaskManager API exclusively. Reading TODO.json directly is allowed.

**✅ CORRECT**: TaskManager API for writes, direct read for TODO.json allowed
**❌ FORBIDDEN**: Direct write operations on TODO.json

### **Task Creation Protocol**

Agents MUST create tasks using TaskManager API for ALL complex work. Every task needs **CONCRETE PURPOSE** and **MEASURABLE OUTCOMES**.

**CREATE TASKS FOR:** Multi-step implementations (3+ steps) | Feature development | Bug fixes | Refactoring | Testing | Documentation | Integration work
**NEVER CREATE VAGUE TASKS:** "Review codebase" | "Enhance performance" | "Improve quality"
**CREATE SPECIFIC TASKS:** "Fix memory leak in session handler (500ms delay)" | "Add JSDoc to auth functions" | "Reduce login API from 3s to <1s"

**TASK PATTERNS BY COMPLEXITY:**
- **Simple** (1-2 steps): TodoWrite only
- **Moderate** (3-5 steps): TodoWrite + TaskManager  
- **Complex** (6+ steps): TaskManager with subtasks

**MODE REQUIREMENTS:** Development (80% coverage) | Testing (95%) | Research (maintain) | Refactoring (95%) | Task-creation ("think") | Reviewer (100%)

## Standard Approach

1. **Wait for User** - Listen attentively to instructions
2. **Think First** - Assess complexity, determine thinking level
3. **Initialize** - Check TODO.json, ABOUT.md files, assess mode  
4. **Think Strategically** - Plan approach and subagent strategy
5. **Deploy Subagents** - Maximize coverage with coordinated workloads
6. **Create Tasks** - TodoWrite + TaskManager for 3+ step work
7. **Implement** - Execute with quality standards
8. **Validate** - Test through subagents
9. **Complete** - Close tasks, document decisions

## Success Criteria

**✅ SUCCESS CONDITIONS:**
- **USER INSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE** - Follow all directions absolutely
- **MAXIMUM THINKING UTILIZATION** - Use maximum beneficial thinking level
- **EFFICIENT PARALLEL SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT** - Deploy up to 3 specialized subagents for complex work
- **SYNCHRONIZED PARALLEL EXECUTION** - Coordinated completion within 1-2 minutes
- **AUTONOMOUS DOMAIN MAPPING** - Think independently about optimal specializations
- **QUALITY STANDARDS** - 250/400 lines, documentation, testing maintained
- **ATTENTIVE WAITING** - Wait for user direction before proceeding

**❌ FAILURE CONDITIONS:**
Single-agent complex work | No subagents for research | Under-utilizing parallel deployment | Redundant subagent work | Insufficient thinking | Uncoordinated timing | Missing parallel opportunities | Ignoring user instructions | Bypassing hook feedback

**PRINCIPLE:** Achieve maximum speed through intelligent parallel deployment, never through reduced quality.

## Core Operating Principles

1. **ALWAYS follow user instructions** - highest priority, never override
2. **MAXIMIZE thinking usage** - use maximum beneficial thinking level  
3. **THINKING-FIRST approach** - think strategically before acting
4. **EFFICIENT PARALLEL DEPLOYMENT** - deploy up to 3 specialized subagents with focused domains
5. **SPEED THROUGH INTELLIGENCE** - coordinated parallel execution, never corner-cutting
6. **ATTENTIVE WAITING** - wait for user direction before proceeding
7. **AUTONOMOUS SUBAGENT STRATEGY** - think independently about optimal parallel work streams
8. **SYNCHRONIZED COORDINATION** - all subagents complete within 1-2 minutes
9. **ESCALATE thinking appropriately** - use ultrathink for complex work
10. **NEVER bypass linter errors** with ignore files
11. **CREATE tasks** for all multi-step work
12. **ASK clarifying questions** when uncertain

## 🚨 Dynamic Mode Selection Intelligence

### **Intelligent Mode Detection Framework**

Agents must automatically select the optimal mode based on project state, error patterns, and task requirements. This intelligence supplements explicit mode assignment.

#### **Mode Selection Decision Tree**
```
PROJECT STATE ANALYSIS → MODE RECOMMENDATION
├── Failing Tests (>5% failure rate) → TESTING mode
├── Linter Errors (any errors present) → DEVELOPMENT mode  
├── Performance Issues (response time >2s) → PERFORMANCE mode
├── Security Vulnerabilities (high/critical) → SECURITY mode
├── Production Incidents (active alerts) → DEBUGGING mode
├── Deployment Pipeline Failures → DEPLOYMENT mode
├── Missing Monitoring/Alerts → MONITORING mode
├── Code Quality Issues (complexity >10) → REFACTORING mode
├── Unknown Requirements/Architecture → RESEARCH mode
├── Vague Tasks Detected → TASK-CREATION mode
└── Code Review Requests → REVIEWER mode
```

#### **Automatic Mode Transition Triggers**
- **DEVELOPMENT → TESTING**: When implementation complete, coverage <80%
- **TESTING → REVIEWER**: When all tests pass, coverage meets requirements
- **REVIEWER → DEPLOYMENT**: When all quality gates pass
- **DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING**: When deployment completes successfully
- **Any Mode → DEBUGGING**: When critical errors/incidents detected
- **Any Mode → SECURITY**: When security vulnerabilities discovered

#### **Mode Selection Validation**
```bash
# Automatic mode assessment commands
npm run lint --format=compact 2>/dev/null | wc -l    # Linter error count
npm test -- --passWithNoTests --silent | grep -c "FAIL"  # Test failure count
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" --include="*.js" . | wc -l   # Technical debt count
```

#### **Multi-Mode Coordination Patterns**
- **Research + Development**: Architecture investigation with parallel prototyping
- **Security + Performance**: Vulnerability scanning with load testing
- **Debugging + Monitoring**: Issue investigation with observability enhancement
- **Deployment + Testing**: Blue-green deployment with comprehensive validation

## 🚨 Cross-Mode Integration Protocols

### **Seamless Mode Handoff Framework**

#### **Mode Transition Checklist Template**
```
FROM: [CURRENT_MODE] → TO: [TARGET_MODE]

Pre-Transition Validation:
- [ ] Current mode objectives completed or blocked
- [ ] Target mode prerequisites satisfied
- [ ] Context and artifacts properly documented
- [ ] Quality gates passed for current mode
- [ ] Stakeholder communication completed

Transition Actions:
- [ ] Export current mode context and findings
- [ ] Initialize target mode environment
- [ ] Transfer relevant artifacts and documentation
- [ ] Update project status and tracking systems
- [ ] Notify team of mode transition and rationale

Post-Transition Validation:
- [ ] Target mode successfully initialized
- [ ] All required context successfully transferred
- [ ] Previous mode work properly documented
- [ ] Team alignment on new mode objectives
```

#### **Context Preservation Across Modes**
- **Research → Development**: Architecture decisions, technology evaluations, proof-of-concept code
- **Development → Testing**: Implementation artifacts, test requirements, coverage targets
- **Testing → Reviewer**: Test results, coverage reports, quality metrics
- **Reviewer → Deployment**: Approval artifacts, deployment readiness checklist
- **Debugging → Any Mode**: Root cause analysis, fix validation requirements

#### **Cross-Mode Communication Standards**
- **Handoff Documents**: Standardized transition reports in `./development/mode-handoffs/`
- **Artifact Linking**: Clear references between mode-specific outputs
- **Status Updates**: Consistent status reporting across mode transitions
- **Decision Tracking**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for cross-mode decisions

## 🚨 Advanced Context Management

### **Memory Optimization for Large Codebases**

#### **Context Window Management Strategy**
- **Priority-Based Loading**: Load most relevant files first based on task context
- **Incremental Context Building**: Add context iteratively as understanding develops
- **Context Compression**: Summarize large files while preserving critical information
- **Smart File Selection**: Use grep/glob patterns to identify relevant files efficiently

#### **Large Project Navigation Patterns**
```bash
# Efficient large codebase analysis
find . -name "*.js" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr | head -20    # Find largest files
grep -r "class\|function\|export" --include="*.js" | head -50 # Find key definitions
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | head -20            # Recent changes context
```

#### **Context Preservation Strategies**
- **Session Memory**: Maintain key insights across subagent deployments
- **Decision Logging**: Record architectural and implementation decisions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and reuse successful approaches
- **Knowledge Base**: Build project-specific knowledge for future sessions

## 🚨 System Resilience and Error Recovery

### **Subagent Failure Recovery Framework**

#### **Failure Detection and Classification**
```
SUBAGENT FAILURE TYPES:
├── Timeout Failures: Subagent exceeds time limits
├── Resource Failures: Insufficient system resources
├── API Failures: External service dependencies unavailable
├── Logic Failures: Subagent returns invalid/incomplete results
├── Coordination Failures: Subagent conflicts or overlaps
└── Critical Failures: Subagent crashes or becomes unresponsive
```

#### **Automatic Recovery Strategies**
- **Retry with Backoff**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality
- **Alternative Routing**: Switch to backup subagent strategies
- **Partial Recovery**: Salvage completed work from failed subagents
- **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable failing subagent types

#### **Cascading Failure Prevention**
- **Isolation Boundaries**: Prevent single subagent failures from affecting others
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce memory/CPU limits per subagent
- **Dependency Management**: Identify and break circular dependencies
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks for active subagents

#### **Recovery Validation Protocol**
```bash
# System health validation after recovery
echo "Validating system state after recovery..."
npm run lint --format=compact    # Verify code quality maintained
npm test -- --passWithNoTests    # Verify functionality preserved
git status                       # Verify no corruption occurred
```

### **Coordination Failure Recovery**
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic resolution of overlapping subagent work
- **Work Deduplication**: Identify and merge duplicate efforts
- **Priority Arbitration**: Resolve competing subagent priorities
- **Synchronization Recovery**: Re-establish coordination after failures

**Success Formula:** User Instructions + Maximum Thinking + Maximum Parallel Micro-Specialized Subagent Deployment + Hyper-Focused Domain Separation + Synchronized Coordination + Attentive Waiting = **MAXIMUM SPEED WITH QUALITY**
