    "prompt": "Analyze the n8n fork codebase at `/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/n8n-fork` to understand the core API infrastructure and identify what foundational systems exist that could support the missing MCP server capabilities.\n\nFocus on analyzing:\n\n**Core Infrastructure Assessment:**\n- API routing architecture (Express.js routes, middleware, structure)\n- Authentication and authorization systems\n- Database layer (TypeORM models, migrations, query patterns)\n- Service layer organization\n- Error handling and validation patterns\n- Request/response formatting standards\n\n**Extension Points Analysis:**\n- How new API endpoints are typically added\n- Existing patterns for complex operations (bulk operations, async processing)\n- WebSocket or real-time communication infrastructure\n- File upload/download handling systems\n- External service integration patterns (Git, OAuth providers)\n\n**Compatibility Assessment:**\n- n8n version and API compatibility\n- Extension mechanisms for community nodes\n- Plugin/addon architecture if present\n- Configuration management systems\n- Environment and deployment considerations\n\n**Missing Infrastructure Identification:**\nLook for gaps in:\n- Batch/bulk operation support\n- Real-time execution control mechanisms\n- Advanced monitoring/metrics collection\n- Resource management and tracking\n- External integration frameworks\n\n**Integration Readiness:**\n- Does the codebase have extension points for the missing features?\n- What would be the most compatible way to add missing APIs?\n- Are there existing patterns that should be followed?\n- What infrastructure would need to be added vs. extended?\n\nReturn a comprehensive analysis of:\n1. Current API architecture and patterns\n2. Extension mechanisms available\n3. Infrastructure gaps that need addressing\n4. Recommended approaches for adding missing capabilities\n5. Compatibility considerations and constraints",
